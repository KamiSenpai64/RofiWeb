# Rofi Web Searcher

A simple web searcher built with **Rofi**, designed to quickly search the web directly from your Linux desktop environment. This tool is ideal for anyone who uses Rofi as a launcher and wants to search the web without opening a browser first.

### Features

- Fast and efficient search integration with Rofi.
- Easily configurable and modular for bookmarks, different search engines and more
- Lightweight and minimal setup.

# Installation

### Git Hook added. If you have hooks disabled, or you are not using a git client that supports hooks, install it manually using the install.sh script
	
	./install.sh

## Prerequisites

- [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) must be installed on your system.

- A web browser for viewing the search results.

## Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

	``git clone https://github.com/KamiSenpai64/RofiWeb.git``

2. Navigate to the directory:
	
	``cd RofiWeb``

3. Make the script executable (if applicable):
	
	``chmod +x web-search.sh``

4. Add the script to your system's PATH or launch it directly from the terminal:
	
	``./web-search.sh firefox google``

## Usage

- Run the script through Rofi by binding it to a keyboard shortcut 

- i3wm
	For i3wm, you need to edit the config file inside ~/.config/i3/ and add the following line, with the keybind you desire and the file path you set, and reload i3wm config file ($mod+l by default)

	```
	bindsym $mod+l exec /path/to/rofi-web.sh browser search_engine
	```

- dwm 
	For dwm, you need to edit the config.h file, found in the directory where you downloaded dwm,add the following line with the keybind you desire and the file path you set, and recompile dwm with `make && sudo make install`
	
	```
	{ MODKEY, XK_l, spawn, SHCMD("/path/to/rofi-web.sh browser search_engine") },
	```

- hyprland
	For Hyprland, you need to edit the hyprland.conf file inside ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf,add the following line with the keybind you desire and the file path you set, and reload hyprland with `hyprctl reload`
	
	```
	bind=SUPER, L, exec, /path/to/rofi-web.sh browser search_engine
	```

- Or run it manually from the terminal (from inside the RofiWeb directory)
	
	```
	./rofi-web.sh browser search_engine
	```

## Configuration

- The script can be modified to your liking by changing the config files inside RofiWeb/:

	- There is no default browser, can be set to anyone.

	- Default search engine is Google but can be changed to anything else.
	
	- Might need to change default file paths!!

## Why?

- I guess some people might ask: Why would I use this instead of opening a browser and searching for whatever I need?
	My answer: yes.
	- I have been using i3wm for quite some time now and I always loved it. so I always tried to make everything as customized as possible. At first, this was a script for opening files in Okula, but then, I thought: I will do it for web searching , music, PDF files, and so on. I had a plethora of ideas, so here is the first one. I will make the next ones soon, and if anyone likes this project, thumbs up! Use, customize, and change it to your liking. All is welcome.
